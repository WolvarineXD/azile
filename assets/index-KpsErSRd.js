      Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to residents of India, based on their biometric and demographic data. Launched on 28 January 2009, Aadhaar is the world’s largest biometric ID system and has been voluntarily adopted by over 138.3 crore residents as of October 2024. The program is governed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and administered by UIDAI, a statutory authority established under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016. Aadhaar aims to provide a universal identity infrastructure that eliminates duplicate and fake identities, and ensures easier and more efficient access to government services and benefits.

The Aadhaar number is linked to the individual’s photograph, ten fingerprints, and two iris scans, all stored in a centralized and secure database. It serves as a proof of identity and address, but not as proof of citizenship. Aadhaar is widely used for Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), opening bank accounts, accessing welfare schemes, insurance, pension services, and more. While first-time enrollment is free, demographic updates cost ₹50 and biometric updates cost ₹100. Aadhaar is valid for a lifetime and can be verified online using the Aadhaar Verification Service provided by UIDAI.

UIDAI was originally formed in 2009 as an attached office under the Planning Commission and was granted statutory status in 2016. It is responsible for issuing Aadhaar numbers, maintaining and updating the Aadhaar database, and managing the authentication infrastructure. The UIDAI operates data centers in Bengaluru and Manesar to securely manage the Aadhaar database across over 7,000 servers. Aadhaar numbers are randomly generated and are designed to prevent profiling or misuse of personal data.

Despite its wide adoption and utility, Aadhaar has been at the center of legal and privacy debates in India. In 2017, the Supreme Court of India declared the right to privacy as a fundamental right, and in a 2018 judgment, upheld the constitutionality of Aadhaar while ruling that it cannot be made mandatory for services like opening bank accounts, obtaining mobile connections, or school admissions. Various civil rights groups have raised concerns about surveillance and exclusion, especially in cases where welfare delivery is linked to Aadhaar.

Nonetheless, Aadhaar remains a cornerstone of India’s digital governance efforts. It plays a key role in streamlining the delivery of government services, enhancing transparency, and reducing fraud. It is used in a wide range of applications such as LPG subsidy distribution, public distribution systems, pensions, e-KYC, digital lockers, and more. Residents who are already registered under the National Population Register are not required to re-enroll for Aadhaar. Overall, Aadhaar continues to evolve as a foundational identity tool, enabling more inclusive and efficient public service delivery across the country.

      Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system and protocol developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. Designed to facilitate instant inter-bank transactions, UPI enables both peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) payments directly from mobile devices. It operates on top of the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and functions as an open-source application programming interface (API) regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Users must register their mobile number with their bank to use UPI, and transactions can be initiated using a recipient’s UPI ID, ensuring quick and secure money transfers. Indian banks began releasing their UPI-enabled apps on Google Play starting from 25 August 2016.

UPI has played a pivotal role in transforming India’s digital payment ecosystem and has positioned the country as a global leader in instant payments, accounting for 46% of all real-time payment transactions worldwide in 2022. By November 2022, UPI had surpassed 300 million monthly active users, reflecting its widespread adoption. According to NPCI data, 12.20 billion UPI transactions worth ₹18.41 lakh crore (approximately $222.17 billion) were processed in January 2024 alone—a 41.72% increase in value from the previous year. For the full year 2023, UPI transactions in India reached a staggering ₹182 lakh crore (about $2.2 trillion), marking a 59% increase in volume and a 45% increase in value compared to 2022. In July 2024, the average UPI transaction value was ₹1,430, with the system handling over 5,390 transactions per second.

The success of UPI is not just financial but also symbolic, emerging as a soft power tool and one of India’s most impactful midtech financial innovations. It demonstrates the strength of scalable, inclusive digital infrastructure and has laid the foundation for replicable financial technology across emerging economies.

      AAPI Setu is a government-backed API (Application Programming Interface) platform launched under the Digital India initiative by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and maintained by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). It acts as a centralized API gateway that enables secure and seamless integration between government departments, public services, and third-party service providers.

Launched to promote data exchange and service delivery in a standardized, interoperable manner, API Setu serves as the digital backbone for building citizen-centric and developer-friendly services across the country. By using APIs, organizations can fetch, verify, and validate data from various government sources such as Aadhaar, PAN, Digilocker, Bharat BillPay, GSTN, and more—without the need for paper-based processes.

The platform promotes:

Ease of Doing Business by simplifying onboarding of APIs for government services
Efficiency and transparency in service delivery
Reusability of APIs, reducing redundant integrations across departments
Scalability and security, with compliance to government data privacy policies
API Setu powers multiple flagship initiatives like DigiLocker, Aadhaar eKYC, eDistrict services, and educational verifications. It also supports private developers and startups through a sandbox environment for testing integrations.
As of 2024, API Setu hosts hundreds of APIs, with thousands of applications already leveraging its gateway to build smarter, faster, and more reliable services—strengthening India’s vision of "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance.

      The e-Courts project is a major e-Governance initiative launched by the Government of India to digitally empower the Indian judiciary through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Conceived in 2005 by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India, the project aims to make the justice delivery system more accessible, affordable, transparent, and efficient for all citizens. Under Phase I, the government approved the computerization of 14,249 district and subordinate courts by March 2014, with a total budget of ₹935 crore. Phase II, approved in January 2014, further expanded the scope by including over 8,000 new courts, legal service authority offices, and judicial academies. Key objectives include enhanced hardware infrastructure, connectivity to the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), citizen-centric services like centralized filing centers and touchscreen kiosks, and the integration of e-Filing, e-Payment, mobile applications, and document digitization. The project also focuses on performance improvement through process re-engineering and the use of handheld devices for better service delivery. In line with this vision, the High Court of Kerala became one of the early implementers by launching e-Courts and introducing SMS-based notifications for case-related updates in 2014. Overall, the e-Courts project represents a significant step toward modernizing the Indian judicial system and ensuring efficient and timely access to justice.
